The [project](https://github.com/mshakib/COVID-19) has been forked from a research [redicting mortality risk in patients with COVID-19 using machine learning to help medical decision-making](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352648320300702?via%3Dihub#bib9). 

The research has included different machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

I am trying to add further more algorithms to see if they can predict with even more accuracy. I have already added XG Boost.
